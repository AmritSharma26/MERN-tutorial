        <p>
          Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the
          creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the
          kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version
          control system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in
          Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the University of
          Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in
          1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely
          used kernels in the world, powering everything from smartphones to
          supercomputers.
