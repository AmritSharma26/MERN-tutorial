00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.760
I’ve got an idea for a Heinz Ketchup Commercial.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.440
I was at this super posh restaurant.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.640
Super posh.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.400
The type of place that has chandeliers, and paintings on the wall,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.640
and way too many forks.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120
I think classical music was playing…

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
maybe it was jazz…

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.280
no, definitely classical.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.560
The hostess walks up to me, she says

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.680
“Mr. Sheeran, is this your first time dining with us?”

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720
and I say

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.600
“yep”.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.960
The waiter comes over, he’s telling me about the specials:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
“Super fancy, fancy vegetables, fancy sauces.”

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.000
I said,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.040
“Sounds fancy”.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.320
So, fast forward and the food comes.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.520
The waiter goes on to tell me

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.720
“We are proud to present this farm to table blah blah blah,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
posh and fancy blah blah blah, with a side of blah blah blah.”

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.720
You know the food looked good,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.480
I just thought there was something missing.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.960
So, I reach into my bag

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
and I take out the only thing that can complete me.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.040
And at that point, the whole world came to a stop.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.240
And the waiter was screaming,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.560
through his eyes, “Nooooooo”.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.240
So that’s my idea,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.000
do you want to do it?
